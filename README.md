## What is this?

mousemove.js makes it easy to move an larger element (say, an image) in a smaller parent container on mousemove.  This is great for zoomed-in views of images. jQuery required.

## Usage

```javascript
$('.myelement').mousemove(options);
```

## Options

* __x (bool, true):__ On false, element won't move on x-axis.
* __y (bool, true):__ On false, element won't move on y-axis.
